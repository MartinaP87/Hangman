# HANGMAN
[View the live project here](https://martinap87.github.io/Hangman/)

Hangman is a classic word game. This game is a fun way of learning vocabulary, and it's especially useful for remembering the spelling of new words.  
The website's goal is to provide a challenging, educational game to entertain the online user. 
Hangman's target is adults looking for a short game with no long-term commitments, something familiar that brings back memories of the good old days, and young adults keen to learn new words in a fun way.

## FEATURES:

### The Landing Page
 <img src ="readme-images/landing-page.png">

- The page landing includes a background image with all the other features overlaid to allow the user to see the content of the site.

### The Instructions
<img src="readme-images/instructions.png">

- In this section, the user has an explanation of how the game works.
- This section will desappear when the game starts leaving room for the Input section.

### The Input Board
<img src="readme-images/input.png">

- This section appears when the user types its first guessed letter, and it keeps adding each letter typed.
- This part is a reminder of the letters typed, and it helps the user to proceed with the game without making the same mistakes.

### The Hangman
<img src="readme-images/hangman.png">

- This section changes the background every time the user types the wrong letter building the "hangman"; when the hangman is complete, the game is over, and the user loses. However, if the user guesses the word before then, it will display the victory background image.
- From this feature, the user can see how close he/she is to lose the game.

### The Score
<img src="readme-images/scores.png">

- The score will update every time the game is over: if the user wins, the score under the happy face will increase by 1; if the user loses, the score under the sad face will increase by 1.
- From this feature, the user can see how many games have been lost or won.

### The Underscores
<img src="readme-images/letters.png">

- This section generates every time the game is loaded. Every underscore represents a letter of the chosen word. When the user guesses the correct letter, it gets displayed in the respective space.
- From this feature, the user can see how long the word is and, through correct guessings,  the letter's position. This section helps the user to win the game.

### The Final Message
<img src="readme-images/final-message.png">

- This section pops up when the game is over. If the user wins, it shows a message of congratulations, otherwise of encouragement. Either way, below the statement, it displays the secret word, its definition, and the "play again!" button.
- This section acknowledges the user of the game's result and enriches the user's vocabulary by defining the meaning of the word that could have been previously unknown. 

### The "Play Again!" Button
<img src="readme-images/restart.png">

- This clickable button restarts the game without affecting the scores.
It resets the hangman, the input section, and along with the word, it updates the underscore section.
- This button is displayed when the game is over and allows the user to play again.

## Testing:
Testing: 
- The project has been tested on different browsers to ensure the website functions correctly, and the results are satisfactory in Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox. 
- I can confirm that the website is responsive after going through all the standard portals available in dev tools.

- All the pages went through Lighthouse in dev tools, giving positive results for readability, color contrast, and accessibility:

### Validator Testing:
- HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmartinap87.github.io%2FHangman%2F);
- CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmartinap87.github.io%2FHangman%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en);
- JSHint
No errors were found when passing through the official [(JSHint) validator](https://jshint.com/), 
even though some warning messages have been detected due to the usage of 'template literal syntax'.

- Some console.log have also been kept for development.
## Bugs:
### First Bug
- When pressing the letters not included in the secret word, I noticed that the image of the hangman wasn't changing.
- This was because for the images, I had used a relative file path in script.js:
url(../images/img0.png)
- Replacing it with url(assets/images/img0.png) fixed the problem
### Second Bug
- When writing the code for the buildHangman function, I set the variable numberOfAttempts = 0, 
- This had made the first wrong attempt to be considered as 0, making the game run 1 step longer and delaying the hangman images.
- Setting the variable numberOfAttempts = 1, fixed the problem

## Deployment:
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab;
- On the menu on the left, under Code and Automation, click on Pages;
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch;
- Once the main branch has been selected, click on Save;
- At the top of the page will then appear the message ???Your site is ready to be published at??? and the URL;
- Refresh the page, and the message will change to ???Your site is published at??? and the active URL.
- The live link can be found here - https://martinap87.github.io/Hangman/
